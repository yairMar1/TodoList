## 💾 Local Storage Persistence
All todos are automatically saved in your browser using the localStorage API.
Even if you refresh or close the tab, your tasks remain stored locally on your device(you can delete them from the local storage).

To view the stored data manually:

1. Open Developer Tools (Right-click → Inspect)

2. Go to the Application tab

3. Expand Local Storage

4. Select your site’s URL

5. Look for the key named "todos"
